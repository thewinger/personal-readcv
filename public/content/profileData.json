    "about": "As a product designer, I simplify daily workflows for users. While my primary focus is on design, I also enjoy exploring development through side projects.\n\nMy expertise in both design and development allows me to bridge the gap between these fields, fostering better collaboration and understanding.\n\nOutside of work, you might find me skiing on the slopes or overlanding in the desert."
